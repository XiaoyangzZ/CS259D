Our Problem Proposal:

    Our suggested problem is a possible extension of the
    botnet/IDS assignment that has been on the last two problem
    sets. We enjoyed this assignment as it allowed us to get a sense
    of the complexities involved from the perspectives of both the
    attackers the defenders.

    We thought that it would be interesting to reformulate the
    assignment somewhat to add interaction between the different
    groups.

    Groups would have one assignment period to write a preliminary
    attack with a structure and purpose of their choice potentially
    with the aid of some starter code to handle privilege escalation
    etc. Simultaneously they would also build a primitive IDS that
    would be capable of detecting and removing at least their attack
    if detected on a system.

    Evaluation of the assignment would be based on networking a series
    of virtual machines together. Each machine runs one of the groups'
    IDSs. Attacks are then distributed across the machines, either via
    programs running on these VMs or by the TA's VM. Attacks would be
    assessed on their functionality in performing some nefarious task
    without detection, and the IDS's in their ability to detect and
    mitigate the various attacks.

    Followup assignments could include:
             Forensics on the network logs/state of the system after the attacks,
             with emphasis on separating out the attack types and vectors.

             A followup allowing improvement of the attack and or detection system
             on the basis of the forensics conducted.

Other considerations:
    Because this could be a somewhat involved assignment, it would
    probably be helpful to have some amount of starter materials
    akin to the ubuntu distribution we were giving for working on the IDS.
